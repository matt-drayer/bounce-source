          <p>
            You will be responsible for the actions of anyone acting on your behalf on or with

            <strong>Indemnification</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Bounce and its affiliates and their
            respective managers, officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors,
            service providers, subcontractors, content providers and suppliers from and against any
            and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable
            attorneys’ fees and expenses and court costs, arising or resulting from your use of this
            Site and any violation of these Terms of Use. If you cause a technical or other
            disruption of this Site or the systems transmitting this Site to you or others, you
            agree to be responsible for any and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages and
            costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses and court costs, arising or
            resulting from that disruption. Bounce reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume
            exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you and, in
            any such case, you agree to cooperate with Bounce in the defense of such matter.

          <p>
            <strong>Arbitration</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Any disputes that may arise between you and Bounce under these Terms of Use or from or
            with respect to your use of this Site (including, without limitation, from or with
            respect to any on-line or in-person interactions that you many have with other users of
            this Site) shall be submitted for binding arbitration to the American Arbitration
            Association (the “Association”), in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, such
            disputes to be determined and resolved by the Association under the Association’s rules
            and procedures as may be in effect at the time that the dispute is submitted to the
            Association. You and Bounce hereby agree to share the costs of any arbitration equally.
            The final arbitration decision shall be enforceable in the courts of the State of New
            York and in the courts of any other state in which you or we reside or may be located.
            In the event that this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by any court of
            competent jurisdiction, then this Agreement shall be as binding and enforceable as if
            this paragraph were not a part hereof and resolution of any dispute arising hereunder
            shall in any such case be before a federal or New York State court of competent
            jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, and each of you and
            Bounce submits to the personal jurisdiction of any such court in any such case and
            waives any defense that any such court is an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing in this paragraph, however, in the case of any failure by you to make any
            payment for any booking, Bounce shall have the option to proceed in arbitration as
            provided in this paragraph or to seek to recover such payment in a federal or New York
            State court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York
            City, and you submit to the personal jurisdiction of any such court in any such case and
            waive any defense that any such court is an inconvenient forum.{' '}

              WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT YOU OR BOUNCE MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
              DISPUTE. FURTHERMORE, WITHOUT INTENDING IN ANY WAY TO LIMIT THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE
              PROVIDED FOR ABOVE IN THIS PARAGRAPH, TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY DISPUTE IS NOT ARBITRATED
              BUT IS INSTEAD BROUGHT IN COURT BY BOUNCE AS PROVIDED ABOVE IN THIS PARAGRAPH, EACH OF
              YOU AND BOUNCE IRREVOCABLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT YOU OR BOUNCE MAY

              ABOVE AND THE WAIVERS OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL SET FORTH ABOVE ARE MATERIAL PARTS OF
              THESE TERMS OF USE AND OF THE AGREEMENT THAT THESE TERMS OF USE CONSTITUTE.
